Support and community
=====================

Here are some places to discuss Narya, including asking questions and getting help:

- There is a dedicated Narya channel on the `homotopy type theory zulip server <https://hott.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/505213-Narya>`_.  This is a good place to ask general questions and give feedback.  Important changes and feature releases are sometimes announced there.
- You can open issues on `github <https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya/issues>`_.  This is a good choice if you think you've found a bug in Narya (any time it says "Anomaly" or "bug", that is a bug), or if you have a suggestion for a new feature or an improvement.
- You can also contact the primary developer `Mike Shulman <https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/>`_ privately, by email or by direct message on Zulip.
- If you "watch" the `github repository <https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya>`_, you will be notified of pull requests, which will hopefully include all breaking syntax changes and large feature releases.
